# Introduction

This investigation gives you practice with data transformation and data
visualization R procedures from Chapters 1 and 3. You will use **the
flights** data set from the nycflights package.

# Questions

1.  Which three carriers have the worst average arrival delays? Your
    script should just print the top 3 carrier codes and their
    associated delays.

**Answer:**

2.  Create a scatterplot (Hint: `geom_point()`) of average departure
    delay by month for three major airlines American, Delta and United.
    You can use the **airlines** data set to find the carrier code for
    these airlines. Your plot should use a different color for each
    airline. In which three months do delays tend to be longest?

**Answer:**

3.  How do delays vary over the course of the day? Illustrate your
    answer with a plot. (Hint: Consider hourly averages.)
